In this assignment your are supposed to add functionality for the +10, +15, +20 buttons

The +5 button functionality is already done for you as an example.

Description of what should happen when the buttons are clicked is described below.

the value in the <h1> tag should increment based on the value of the button clicked

e.g;

if the value in the button is +10 it should take the previous value in the <h1> tag and increment 10 to it. this is also what should happen if the +20 button is clicked. The previous value should be taken and 20 added onto it.
